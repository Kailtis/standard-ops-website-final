# Progress (April 26, 2025)

## What Works
- The website structure exists with multiple components for different sections (Hero, Services, Footer, etc.).
- Basic layout and styling are in place using Tailwind CSS.
- Animations are implemented using Framer Motion.
- Social media icons are present in the footer.
- Basic blog structure implemented on `blog-page-branch`:
    - Routing for `/blog` and `/blog/:slug`.
    - `BlogPage` with filtering, pagination logic, and component placeholders.
    - `BlogPostPage` for displaying individual posts.
    - Reusable blog components (`BlogPostCard`, `HighlightedPost`, `BlogPostGrid`, `TopicFilter`, `PaginationComponent`).
    - Mock data source (`mockBlogPosts.ts`).

## What's Left to Build
- **Blog Feature:**
    - Replace mock data with real content (or implement Markdown/CMS fetching).
    - Refine styling and layout as needed.
    - Implement potential enhancements (e.g., search, advanced pagination).
- **General:**
    - Update X icon link in `Footer.tsx` if URL is provided later.

## Current Status
- **Completed:**
    - Removed "learn more" link from `ServicesSection.tsx`.
    - Removed privacy policy text from `HeroSection.tsx`.
    - Updated social icons in `Footer.tsx`:
        - Added LinkedIn icon and link.
        - Replaced Facebook icon with imported X logo (`Untitled design.png`). The link remains `#`.
        - Removed duplicate Twitter bird icon.
    - Removed "Pricing" link from `Navbar.tsx`.
    - **Blog Feature (on `blog-page-branch`):**
        - Created Git branch `blog-page-branch`.
        - Added blog routes to `App.tsx`.
        - Updated Navbar link for `/blog`.
        - Defined `BlogPost` interface in `src/types/blog.ts`.
        - Created mock data in `src/data/blogPosts.ts`.
        - Created page components: `BlogPage.tsx`, `BlogPostPage.tsx`.
        - Created blog UI components: `BlogPostCard.tsx`, `HighlightedPost.tsx`, `BlogPostGrid.tsx`, `TopicFilter.tsx`, `PaginationComponent.tsx`.
        - Integrated components into `BlogPage.tsx`.
        - Adjusted `HighlightedPost.tsx` layout (image aspect ratio, max-width) based on feedback.
        - Fixed Navbar links (`Navbar.tsx`) to correctly navigate to homepage sections from `/blog` (used `<Link>`, prepended `/`).
        - Implemented scrolling logic (`Index.tsx`) using `useLocation` and `window.scrollTo` to handle navigating to homepage sections via hash links from other pages.
- **Pending:**
    - User verification of homepage section scrolling fix on the local development server (`blog-page-branch`).
    - Decision on blog content source (mock data, Markdown, CMS).
    - Further refinement of blog styling/features based on feedback.
    - Update X icon link in `Footer.tsx` if URL is provided later.

## Known Issues
- None reported currently.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial memory bank structure created.
- Decided to leave the X icon link as `#` in the footer per user instruction.
- Corrected image path for X logo in the footer by importing it.
- **Blog Feature Decisions:**
    - Created feature on a separate branch (`blog-page-branch`).
    - Started with mock data for initial UI development.
    - Used Shadcn UI components for consistency.
    - Named pagination component `PaginationComponent` to avoid conflicts.
    - Adjusted highlighted post aspect ratio to `aspect-[2.5/1]` to reduce height.
    - Fixed Navbar links using `<Link>` and prepending `/` to ensure navigation back to homepage sections.
    - Implemented hash scrolling on `Index.tsx` using `useLocation` and `window.scrollTo` with offset calculation.
